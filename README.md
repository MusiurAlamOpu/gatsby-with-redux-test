Assalamo Alaikum there!
it's me, *** Musiur Alam Opu ***.

Here in this project I have tried out redux with gatsby in order to use global state and something like regular states.

The steps I have followed by freecodecamp.org
================================================
1. Creating a folder in src folder and named as context
2. Then also create app.js, index.js and ReduxWrapper.js files in context folder.

3. The first step I have taken in app.js is initialized default state, then create actions and reducers according to the article on the freecodecamp.org.
4. In index.js file I have imported combine reducer from redux and combine all the reducers of app.js
5. In ReduxWrapper.js file I have created redux store to store the states.

6. Finally I have tested the states in /src/pages/index.js file. using a button with toggling the bg color and the dynamic state according to the redux dispatch and state, in word state-management.

Thank you very much for being through out the reading.
